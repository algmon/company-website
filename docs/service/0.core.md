## Part 1: Technical Consulting in General
Technical consulting is the process of advising businesses on how to best use technology and software to benefit their business. It can refer to the design and development, implementation, or management of new technology.

Technical consultants may work for large consulting firms or start their own consulting businesses. They may also specialize in different areas of technology, such as software, hardware, security or infra.

Some common tasks that technical consultants do are:
* Meeting with clients to discuss technological needs
* Assessing information technology behaviors within a company
* Creating policies and procedures to address any issues and improve technological performance
* Overseeing the use of new technology and software to perform tasks more effectively
* Writing and distributing training documents related to new technology
* Leading meetings about technology concerns within a company
* Determining metrics and other methods of analyzing technological performance within a company
* Presenting the results of assessments to clients and stakeholders respectively

## Part 2: Stages in Suanfamama
Our technical consulting process consists of several steps that ensure the quality and efficiency of our services.

### Stage 1: the Presale Stage 售前阶段
This is where we communicate with potential clients and understand their technological needs and challenges. We typically include the following steps:
* Determine prospective sales leads and customers
* Research the customer’s industry, company, and pain points
* Create buyer personas to understand the customer’s goals, challenges, and preferences
* Conduct competitor analysis to identify your unique value proposition and differentiation
* Design presentations and proposals that showcase your solution and benefits
* Perform product demos that highlight the features and functionality of your solution
* Address any customer objections or concerns and provide relevant information
* Follow up with the customer and move them to the next stage of the sales process

### Stage 2: the Business Signing Stage 商务成交阶段
This is where we establish the terms and conditions of our partnership and the scope of our work. The main goal of signing is to create a business collaboration framework, which is a document that outlines the scope, objectives, deliverables, timelines, roles, and communication channels of the collaboration. A business collaboration framework can help you and your client to:
* Align on the vision and goals of the collaboration
* Define the scope and boundaries of the work
* Identify the key stakeholders and decision makers
* Assign roles and responsibilities to each team member
* Establish the deliverables and milestones of the project
* Set the budget and payment terms
* Agree on the communication methods and frequency
* Specify the quality standards and evaluation criteria
* Manage risks and contingencies
* Resolve conflicts and disputes

### Stage 3: the Pricing Stage 项目报价阶段
This is where we determine the optimal price for our technical solutions and services, based on the value we provide to the client and the market conditions. The goal of the pricing stage is to:
* Analyze the costs and benefits of each technical project and solution
* Estimate the expected revenue and profit margin for each technical project and solution
* Consider the competitive landscape and the client’s budget
* Negotiate the best price with the client that reflects the value of our work and meets their expectations
* Finalize the payment terms and conditions and include them in the business collaboration framework
Note: After the completion of this stage, sales & marketing team exit and tech team take the main role.

### Stage 4: the Implementation Stage 项目研发实施阶段
The implementation stage is where you and your client execute the action plans and deliver the technical solutions and services that you agreed on in the previous stages. The implementation stage can be challenging and complex, especially in the era of AI, where technology is constantly evolving and changing. Some of the factors that make the implementation stage different and difficult in the era of AI are:
* More time is needed: AI projects often require more time than traditional projects, because they involve data collection, cleaning, processing, analysis, modeling, testing, and deployment. AI projects also need to be continuously monitored and updated to ensure their accuracy and relevance
* Different evaluation metrics: AI projects often have different and multiple evaluation metrics than traditional projects, because they need to measure not only the technical performance, but also the business impact, ethical implications, and user satisfaction of the AI solutions. AI projects also need to consider the trade-offs and risks involved in using AI, such as bias, privacy, security, and explainability
* Higher uncertainty and complexity: AI projects often have higher uncertainty and complexity than traditional projects, because they involve dealing with dynamic and unpredictable data, environments, and users. AI projects also need to cope with the rapid changes and innovations in the AI field, and adapt to the changing needs and expectations of the clients and stakeholders

To overcome these challenges and ensure a successful implementation stage in the era of AI, you and your client may need to:
* Plan ahead and be flexible: You and your client should plan ahead and anticipate the possible challenges and risks that may arise during the implementation stage, and prepare contingency plans and mitigation strategies. You and your client should also be flexible and agile, and be ready to adjust your plans and solutions as the situation changes.
* Communicate and collaborate: You and your client should communicate and collaborate frequently and effectively, and keep each other updated on the progress, status, and issues of the implementation stage. You and your client should also involve the end-users and other stakeholders in the implementation stage, and solicit their feedback and input.
* Learn and improve: You and your client should learn and improve from the implementation stage, and collect and analyze data and metrics to evaluate the performance and impact of the AI solutions. You and your client should also identify the lessons learned and best practices from the implementation stage, and use them to improve your future projects and collaborations.

The AI world is not perfect therefore our aspiration is to help get it closer to that point.
